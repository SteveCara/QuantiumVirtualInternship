# Quantium Virtual Internship: Project Overview

- Undertook data cleaning, transformation and preparation of a large sample dataset from a major retailer

- Carried out customer analytics to derive insights into customer spending behaviour and high performing products

- Developed a strategy for the spending manager to implement, which would optimise slaes for specific product categories 

- Created a measure to compare different control stores against stores which had recently trialled new layouts

- Used the most suitable control store to benchark performance and used performance analytics to assess the impact of new layouts in trial stores

## Resources

**Python Version:** 3.7

**Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

**Project Basis:** Virtual Internship with Quantium

## Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

 This consisted of the following stages:

- Examined transaction data looking for inconsistencies, missing data and outliers

- Cleaned the data using ordinal mapping and filling of missing values and outliers with statistical best fit values

- Merged customer data with transaction data to create a unified sales dataset

- Defined performance metrics and identified total sales, drivers of sales and highest performing products

- Conducted a deep dive into customer segments to advise which segments should be targeted.  

Some highlights are below.

**Sales Profile (All Stores) - Full Observation Period**

This indicated that the brands with the highest sales were Doritos, Smiths and Kettle. This also revealed that sales were highest in December during the holiday season.

## Experimentation and Uplift Testing

I undertook experimentation and uplift testing to identify control stores, consisting of the following stages:

- Determined total sales revenue and total number of customers on monthly and annual bases and number of transactions per customer

- Normalised salaes values and created a metric to compare the sales performance different control stores to each of the trial stores

- Control stores were selected based on their similarity to trial stores

- The performance of trial stores was compared to the control stores to assess the impact of the new trial layout

Some highlights are below.

 This revealed that the trial layout resulted in higher sales during the trial period.
 
 ## Analytics and Commercial Application
 
 In this stage, I synthesised the results from the previous stages to prepare a summary report to the client. The results informed strategy recommendations for the client.
